Parsing limited to 50 urls (to avoid long wait to test it)

What the program does:
- Parses stocks.xlsx except first line (as it's title)
- Then it parse urls one by one without parallel
- Use `"input type="number"` as first check to apply first condition if a product in stock
- If in the condition regex found `/<button type="submit".*.disabled.*.addToCartButton/m` then it flag as out of stock (because the button to add cart is gray)
- If url 404 then it out of stock
- In the end we get result with {url, state}
